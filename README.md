# conda-docker
Repository of docker containers with bootstrapped installations of conda and python (both 2.7 and 3.6) that are ready to use.

Docker Images are also available from Docker Hub:

This repository was forked from [conda/conda-docker](https://github.com/conda/conda-docker) in order to tag more specific versions and update the images.
